Knex.js is a lightweight SQL query builder that makes it easy to create,
read, update and delete data in databases from a Node.js application. 
We will use Knex for this purpose, but it also has a key feature called
migrations. Migrations can be thought of as "source control for your database".
They allow you to define sets of schema changes that you can apply to any database
and bring it up to date, e.g., migrate it to the desired state.

By using migrations, we'll keep a running history of all changes to our database
in a set of source migration files. Migrations can be used for all database 
structural changes such as adding and dropping tables and columns. The Knex 
migration tooling automatically tracks and applies migrations that are set up 
in migration files.
